The content of this folder is based on a personal project work done for the course "Digital Signal Processing" in Kasetsart University. To get a full understanding of what the project and its goals were about, it is suggested to check the Powerpoint provided in this folder. 

The same audio files that were used in the project presentation are provided in the folder "Audio files". When running the Python script, it is advised to use these files.

The script provided in the folder "Python" is a generalized and merged version of the different, case-by-case scripts used in the original presentation (original scripts can for the most part be seen in the Powerpoint slides).

When the script is ran, the program gives the user instructions on how to proceed.
